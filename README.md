# [JSL09] Submission: Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension
# Project overview
The aim of this project was to create a promise rejection dashboard which is a chrome dashboard extension which contain the weather, information of crypto currency data and the current time and author of the background image.

# Project Process

# Challenges
For this project, I first had challenges with knowing which method to use for getting the time configuration that was required for the project, Second challenge was when I was working on getting the current location of the device I tried different methods which were not right until I saw how they did it in scrimba. I also had a problem with my getCurrentPosition method as my google chrome or microsoft edge were not allowing me unchange the  setting which blocked access to my location, I had to do some changes to how my chrome  views unsecure sites.
